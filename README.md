## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Development Pipeline**: End-to-end software development automation
- **Specialized AI Agents**: Purpose-built agents for each development phase
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive debugging and error recovery
- **Extensive Testing**: Automated test generation and execution
- **Clear Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation and code comments

## 🤖 Agent Roles

- **Planning Agent**: Task analysis and implementation planning
- **Coding Agent**: Code implementation and documentation
- **Execution Agent**: Safe code execution and output capture
- **Debugging Agent**: Error analysis and bug fixing
- **Testing Agent**: Test creation and validation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autogen-dev-framework.git
cd autogen-dev-framework
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from src.agents.team import DevelopmentTeam

async def main():
    # Initialize the development team
    team = DevelopmentTeam()
    
    # Define your coding task
    task = """
    Create a function that:
    1. Takes a list of numbers as input
    2. Returns the sum of all even numbers
    """
    
    # Let the team solve the task
    await team.solve_task(task)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📖 Example Workflows

### 1. Basic Function Implementation
```python
task = "Implement a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
await team.solve_task(task)
```

### 2. Data Structure Implementation
```python
task = """
Create a binary search tree implementation with the following methods:
- insert
- search
- delete
Include proper error handling and documentation.
"""
await team.solve_task(task)
```

### 3. Algorithm Development
```python
task = """
Implement a sorting algorithm that:
1. Takes advantage of partially sorted input
2. Has O(n log n) worst-case complexity
3. Uses minimal extra space
"""
await team.solve_task(task)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Custom Model Configuration
```python
from src.agents.team import DevelopmentTeam
from config import CustomModelConfig

team = DevelopmentTeam(
    model_config=CustomModelConfig(
        model="gpt-4-0125-preview",
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=2000
    )
)
```

### Custom Tools Integration
```python
from src.tools import CustomCodeExecutor

team = DevelopmentTeam(
    tools=[CustomCodeExecutor()]
)
```

```

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Code Analysis
```python
# Get detailed code analysis
analysis = await team.analyze_code(code_snippet)
```

### Test Generation
```python
# Generate comprehensive test suite
tests = await team.generate_tests(implementation)
```

### Performance Optimization
```python
# Optimize existing implementation
optimized_code = await team.optimize_code(
    code=implementation,
    optimization_target="speed"
)
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest src/tests/
```

### Code Style
```bash
# Format code
